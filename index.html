        <h2>My background:</h2>
        <p>I am second generation in Israel. I was born in 1995 to a traditional family. <br> I am the first child of five siblings. three sisters and a brother. <br> My ancestors came to Israel from Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia with the establishment of the State of Israel. <br> As a family we lived in the south of Israel and after high school I enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces for three years. When I finished my military service, I moved to America to develop a better future for myself. In Israel we don't go to college straight after school. We join the army. <br>Today I made some dreams come true. I am happily married and live in the country I always dreamed of. I have a lot of friends, but unfortunately I don't have a profession, so I chose to enroll in studies at Epicodus so that my more distant future can look as good as I want it to be.</p>
        <h2>My passions and hobbies:</h2>
        <p>My biggest passion has always been traveling the world. To this day I have traveled to 20 countries and I can't stop thinking about my next adventure! <br>I like spending time with friends. Going out to parties and eat good food.</p>
